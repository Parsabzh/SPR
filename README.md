# Software Package Recommendation System

## Description
The Software Package Recommendation System is a Python-based application designed to offer recommendations for software packages. This project leverages the powerful search capabilities of Elasticsearch to efficiently process and retrieve relevant software package recommendations.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python
- Elasticsearch

## Installation

### Setting Up Elasticsearch
1. **Download Elasticsearch**: Visit the [Elasticsearch official website](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch) and download the appropriate version for your operating system.

2. **Install Elasticsearch**: Follow the installation instructions provided on the website for your operating system.

3. **Configure Elasticsearch**: 
   - After installation, open the Elasticsearch configuration file `elasticsearch.yml` located in the Elasticsearch directory.
   - Modify the settings as needed. For a basic setup, you may need to set the cluster name and define network settings like the host and port. A simple configuration example is:
     ```
     cluster.name: my-application
     network.host: 127.0.0.1
     http.port: 9201
     ```
   - Save the changes and close the file.

4. **Start Elasticsearch**:
   - Run Elasticsearch by executing `elasticsearch.bat` (for Windows) or `./elasticsearch` (for Unix/Linux) in the Elasticsearch bin directory.
   - Verify that Elasticsearch is running by accessing `http://localhost:9200` in a web browser or using a tool like curl: `curl -X GET "localhost:9201/"`.
